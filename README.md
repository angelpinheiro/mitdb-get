## mitdb-dl

mit-dl is a coomand line tool for downloading and resampling the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database available at [PhysioNet](https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/)

### Getting started

This tool relies on the [xform tool](https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wag/xform-1.htm) from the [WFDB software  package](http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml) to convert the original MIT records, so you need to have it installed in order to use this.
